Line Detection using OpenCV

Overview

This project demonstrates how to detect lines in an image using OpenCV and NumPy in Python. The Jupyter Notebook processes an image step by step, including grayscale conversion, region-of-interest cropping, Gaussian Blur, edge detection with Canny, and line detection using the Hough Transform.

Required Libraries

Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed before running the notebook. You can install them using:

pip install opencv-python matplotlib numpy

Files

LineDetection.ipynb → Jupyter Notebook containing the line detection steps.

How to Run

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing this project.

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook LineDetection.ipynb

Run each cell in order to see the image processing and line detection steps.

Steps in the Notebook

Read the Image: Load an image using OpenCV.

Convert to Grayscale: Simplifies processing.

Define Region of Interest (ROI): Focus on a specific part of the image.

Apply Gaussian Blur: Reduces noise.

Edge Detection (Canny): Detects edges in the image.

Hough Line Transform: Identifies straight lines.

Experimentation

Try different images by replacing 'msg1033807294-27153.jpg' with your own image.

Adjust the Canny edge detection parameters for better results.

Modify the ROI selection to focus on different areas.

Example Output

The notebook visualizes each step with matplotlib, showing the processed images at different stages.
